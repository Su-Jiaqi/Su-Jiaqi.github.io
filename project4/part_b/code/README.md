# README

This is code for project 4.



Note that **I wrote the code for part A and part B separately**. In the end, however, both `main.py` were placed in the same ipynb in order to satisfy the requirements for submitting the job. So to prevent unknown errors at runtime, run `main.py` in Parts a and b respectively to show what I've done.



For both part A & B, just run `python main.py` in the corresponding directory.
